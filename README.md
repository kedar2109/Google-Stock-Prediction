# Google Stock Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict Google stock prices using historical stock data from finacial year 2012 to 2016. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and Deep Learning techniques like LSTM to forecast stock prices.

## Dataset

The project uses the dataset **Google\_Stock\_Price\_Train.csv**, which contains historical stock prices.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow keras
```

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading:** Read the stock price dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Select relevant columns and transform the data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends and patterns.
4. **Model Building:** Implement a machine learning model for prediction.
5. **Prediction & Evaluation:** Generate stock price forecasts and evaluate model performance.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the above command.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `main.ipynb` step by step.

## Results

The model provides a predictive analysis of Google stock prices of January 2017 based on historical trends.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different machine learning models.
- Include additional features like market sentiment analysis.
